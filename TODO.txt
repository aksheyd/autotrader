TODO:
1. Figure out how the API works now
2. Read req_instructions.txt
3. Install requirements onto venv using pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Create a time_series class and add the member functions time_series_daily() and time_series_intraday() it
5. Put the class into a file named 'time_series.py' into a separate folder labelled 'alphavantage_api'
6. Create a file named 'helper_functions.py' for create_url() and place into alphavantage_api folder
7. Learn imports to import the helper functions into time_series.py
8. Then import the alphavantage_api folder files into main.py using __init__.py (do research about it online)
9. Now, have main.py working with just the main() function essentially
10. PyLint everything
